Personal project to excercise styling and responsiveness to represent a client's portfolio for their profession.  This porfolio was made in mind to visually represent a client, along with their information, testimonial reviews, business hours, etc.  A landing page.

Built using React and styled with a mix of custom CSS and Bootstrap.  Always a work in progress.
